## Graphs

Representation of a **directed Graph** using Java data structures, such as Maps.
In this implementation, a graph is represented by nodes or **vertices**, which
are connected by **edges** with an specific weight associated. Vertices linked
by an arc are called adjacent.

The Graph class includes methods for:

- **Retrieving graph info:**
	- Number of vertices
	- List of vertices
	- Number of edges


- **Retrieving vertex info:**
	- Whether a vertex is contained in the graph
	- Indegree of a vertex
	- Outdegree of a vertex
	- Its list of the adjacent vertices 
	

- **Retrieving edge info:**	
	- Whether an edge exists between two vertices
	- The weight associated to the edge
	
	
- **Manipulating graph structure:**	
	- Insert a vertex
	- Insert an edge
	- Delete a vertex
	- Delete an edge
	
	
- **Traversing the graph with:**
	- Depth-first algorithm
	- Breadth-first algorithm
